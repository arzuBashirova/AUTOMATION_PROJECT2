CREATE A WEB ORDER

3. Login using username Tester and password test
4. Click on Order link
5. Enter a random product quantity between 1 and 100
6. Click on Calculate and verify that the Total value is correct.
   The logic of calculating is as follows:
   Price per unit is 100.  The discount of 8 % is applied to quantities of 10+.
   So for example, if the quantity is 8, the Total should be 800. if quant>=10, 92*quantity,else 100*quantity
   If the quantity is 20, the Total should be 1840.
   If the quantity is 77, the Total should be 7084. And so on.
